A static website is the oldest (yet still relevant) form of content on the internet. In a simplified way, it means that all you see in the browser has been "baked" as you see it and there is no machine needed to produce it. In other words, you see the same thing as anyone else does.

## You need:

 - Basic understanding of HTML
 - Basic understanding of CSS
 - Somewhere to put your website (webserver or static files storage)
 - Some domain (can be provided by the former).

 ## Quick success recipe:

 - Use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/tutorials/) to build even a complex website.
 - Use [TailWindCSS](https://scotch.io/tutorials/get-started-with-tailwind-css-in-15-minutes) to avoid learning advanced CSS.
 - Use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) to host your website.
 - Use [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) to store your website source.
 - Use this site [code](https://github.com/sielay/becomingdeveloper.com) as a template.

## Good tutorials:

 - [w3schools.com - How TO - Build a Website](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp)

## But:

 - You don't need to know any above to build a static website. You can use services like Wix or GoDaddy Website Builder (or many others).
 - A static website can load data from elsewhere to provide a dynamic experience.
 - A static website can use technology, that brings personalised experience in your browser (frontend JavaScript).

## Worth learning:
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/home/) as alternatives to Eleventy.
- [Google Lighthouse](https://blog.logrocket.com/lighthouse-and-how-to-use-it-more-effectively/) to check how well your website is done.
