Skills and technologies required for each career path change very fast. Below I list the most up to date basics related to getting job as a web developer.

## Difficulty

 * Very easy to start and get productive

## Bare minimum knowledge

 * HTML
 * JavaScript
   * Basic use of vanilla JS:
     * [JavaScript: The Good Parts](amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) by Douglas Crockford
   * Basics of one of popular JavaScript frameworks
     * React
     * Vue
     * Svelte
 * CSS

## Bare minimum tools

 * Almost any device:
   * Best: laptop/PC with Windows or Mac or Linux
   * Can do: smartphone, tablet
 * Some good editor for code:
   * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - free
   * any other will do

## Good next choices

 * NodeJS - backend using JavaScipt
 * PHP - the most popular backend language, slowly pushed away by NodeJS
 * Pyhon - very universal language used for backend, but also AI, blockchain, games, math

## Fading away technologies

 * Angular - used to be popular frontend framework
