As I slowly move forward I stabilised the outline and got about 2/5 of the text done. More and more I get into content I understand
that much of it will need to be extracted and published as additional resources here. Which isn't bad idea, is it?

As for today the book is has:
 * 70 pages
 * 13950 words
 * 68369 characters excluding spaces
